0.  // How many different colors does each format support?
    Both .bmp and .jpg file formats support three colors: Red, Green, & Blue.
    
1.  // Which of these formats supports animation?
    Neither .bmp nor .jpg supports animation.
    
2.  // What’s the difference between lossy and lossless compression?
    Essentially, lossless compression breaks down a file "as is", so to speak,
    into smaller, more manageable components for the sake of storage/archival
    or transmission.  As the name implies, none of the original data is lost.
    Lossy compression, however, attempts to eliminate redundancies in information,
    and, therefore, the new file will be an "interpretation" of sorts from what
    the original file used to be.
    
3.  // Which of these formats is lossy-compressed?
    JPEG files use a form of lossy compression known as Discrete Cosine Transforms.
    (DCT).  It is somewhat akin to a Laplace Transform in functionality.
    
4.  // What happens, technically speaking, when a file is deleted on a FAT file system?
    The linked list of data clusters that the DOS had used to allocate to the given 
    file is no longer assigned to the file, and becomes "garbage" values to be reallocated
    when needed again in the future.  Until then, such information can potentially lie
    dormant on a computer for and indefinite period of time.
    
5.  // What can someone like you do to ensure (with high probability) that files you delete cannot be recovered?
    In a somewhat trivial answer, one can always physically destroy the hardware.
    Beyond that, there are some additional sanitization techniques, including degaussing 
    and disk overwriting.
    
6.  // What’s stdint.h?
    stdint.h is the header file referenced in bmp.h.  It defines the minimum and maximum
    sizes of, amongst other values, uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t.
    
7.  // What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
        /* uint8_t
        This typedef will hold an 8-bit integer whose first, or Most Significant Bit (MSB)
        is unsigned.
        
        /* uint32_t.
        This typedef will hold a 32-bit integer whose MSB is unsigned.
        
        /* int32_t.
        This typedef will hold a signed 32-bit integer, wherein the MSB denotes its beginning.
        
        /* uint16_t.
        This typedef will hold an unsigned 16-bit integer.
        
8.  // How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
        /* BYTE
        One octet, or eight (unsigned) bits. (One byte)
        
        /* DWORD
        32-bits (four bytes); unsigned.
        
        /* LONG
        32-bits (four bytes); MSB is signed.
        
        /* WORD
        16-bits (two bytes); unsigned.
        
9.  // What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? 
    /*(Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers.)"
    0x42 0x4D in hexadecimal, same as BM in ASCII, or 66; 77.
    
10. // What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
    bfSize is the size of the bitmap file in bytes.  biSize is the number of bytes required by the structure.
    
11. // What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
    If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.  In addition,
    if biHeight is negative, biCompression must be either BI_RGB or BI_BITFIELDS.
     
12. // What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
    (WORD) biBitCount;
    
13. // Why might fopen return NULL in copy.c:37?
    if the variable defined in copy.c:26 is NULL, then fopen would return NULL.  This would
    be the case if argv[2] == NULL (i.e., if "outfile" was missing in the command line input
    due to improper command line structure input by the user.  The program is expecting the
    usage: ./copy infile outfile.
    
14. // Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
    There is only 1 element of data to read (or "fread", so to speak) at any given time
    for this program. It should be noted that although there is only one element of 
    data, the size of that element is determined by the second argument of fread.
           
15. // What value does copy.c:70 assign padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
    padding == 3.  This is based off of the formula:
    int padding =  (4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4;
    with bi.biWidth == 3 && sizeof(RGBTRIPLE) == 3.
    
    
16. // What does fseek do?
    For a stream FILE (a file that reads image pixels), fseek sets the file position
    indicator.
    
17. // What is SEEK_CUR?
    Within the function fseek, SEEK_CUR is the file position indicator's current position.
     
18. // Whodunit?
    Milo Banana dun it.
